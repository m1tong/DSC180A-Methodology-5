Graph ML for Chip Profiling, Mentor: Lindsey Kostas

**1. What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**
The most interesting topic covered in my domain this quarter is using Gerneal Neural Network to predict in different scope. We can use the information of a node's neighbor to make prediction of node, the edge, or the structure of the graph.
**2. Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**
A potential investigation I would like to pursue will focus on the relationship between placement and congestion. 
**3. What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**
A potential change I would make from my Quarter 1 project will be start focusing on real life data and find way to embed the data in size we can use.
**4. What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**
Another Technique I am interested in using in my project will be embedding.
